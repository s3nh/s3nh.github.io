Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a being named Zor. Zor was a curious being, always eager to explore and discover new worlds.
One day, Zor set out on a journey to find the perfect world, a place where everything was perfect and everyone was happy.

Zor traveled for many lightyears, visiting countless planets and meeting all sorts of creatures. But no matter where Zor went,
he always found something to complain about. The weather was too hot on one planet, the food was bland on another,
and the inhabitants of yet another planet were too unfriendly.

Finally, Zor came across a planet that seemed perfect. The weather was just right, the food was delicious, 
and the inhabitants were kind and welcoming. But as Zor settled down to make this planet his new home, 
he realized that he had become so accustomed to finding fault with every world he visited,
that he couldn't enjoy the beauty and perfection of this one.

Feeling disappointed with himself, Zor decided to leave and continue his search for the perfect world.
 But as he traveled, he came to realize that there was no such thing as a perfect world.
 Every planet had its own unique set of problems, and it was up to each individual to make the best of what they had.

Zor returned to the planet he had left, grateful for a second chance. He made friends,
built a home and started a family. He learned to appreciate the small things and was content with his life.
And he realized that the world he had found was not perfect, but it was the perfect world for him.

The end

Moral of the story is that it's not the world that's bad, it's our perception of it.
We should try to find the good in the world around us, rather than focusing on its flaws.
