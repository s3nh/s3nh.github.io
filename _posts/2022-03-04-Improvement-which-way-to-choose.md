Passing time seems to our companion from time to time. The fun fact is that we have make decision because of its existence. 
Assuming theoretically if we live in a world in which time does not exist there is not certain needs to perform fast decisions, make predictions. 
being in a hurry is just made based our concious that there is certain limit of time that we have to live from our first day on this world. 

I ll live you with that thought which make me scary everytime when it jumps right into my brain. But there are far coming consequences and dillemas 
with which we have to be aware, and what is worse, in which we have to live in our daily routine.
