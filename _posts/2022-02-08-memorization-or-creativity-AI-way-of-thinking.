###  Memorization vs Creativity - AI algorithms point of view. 

Skimming throught hackernews through my second coffee this morning I came across question which make my neurons working hard. 

**WIll you ever replace your CEO with an AI assistant**?

Knowing the possibilities of sota AI algorithms and its limitation I would say that I would never replace any human with CEO if it comes to an process in which you have to make decisions. 

The main issue with 'AI' is that it make an judgment by the data it was feed on through the training process. So there is no spark of creativity which will result in behaviours which are far away from expected value. 


**Unpopular opinion**

   I know that hype train change its direction and know we are stuffed with buzzwords like 'Ai algo solve mathematical problem',
   but the question is how the test dataset was prepared and where is the border between excellent memorization and average creativity. 
   Because assuming that we have an infinite number of resources we can teach any algorithm literally anything in limited amount of time.
