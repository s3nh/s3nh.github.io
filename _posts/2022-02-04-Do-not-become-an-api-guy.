While jumping on data science hype train few years ago I thought that it will be tremendous journey. 

And it was, but in actual scheme of reality, things and feelings won't last long. 

I decided to list few things that makes me feel sick on my daily routing. And it really does not matter if its a spare time project or 
my actual job.

1. Great faith in data visualisation and data analysis.
2. Lack of additive values which comes from deploying any dl/ml solutions. 
  -  I think that it is not a secret that we are leaving in a bubble in which there is no real need for automatisation at that scale. 
  -  What has to be done, someone just have to calculate losses which are generated by pilot traps and not properly developement projects. 
  - I bet all of my saving that addivitive value is less significant that costs which were incurred. 
3. Data Scientist become an API guy. Hype train pass by, now all you can do is just starting to retrain to software engineer. 
  There are few signals which indicate that appetite for data science is not longer that high. At first, many companies started to realize 
  that data scientist ne data engineer and there is huge gap between creating a  model and creating an effective solution.
