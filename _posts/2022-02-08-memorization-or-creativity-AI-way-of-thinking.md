Skimming throught hackernews through my second coffee this morning I came across question which make my neurons working hard.

**Will you ever replace your CEO with an AI assistant**? 

Knowing the possibilities of sota AI algorithms and its limitation I would say that I would never replace any human with CEO if it comes to an process in which you have to make decisions. 

The main issue with 'AI' is that it make an judgment by the data it was feed on through the training process. So there is no spark of creativity which will result in behaviours which are far away from expected value. 

Assuming that the measure of success is not correlated with staying inside mean of some behaviours, there is no proper way to drive 
company actions based on some AI algorithms. It is a hypotheses, because I did not see any proposition of AI which is intelligent at that level. 

The fun fact is how training data for that solutions should be gathered. I think that we should gather data, actions, morale, mood and 
some explanatory variable which comes from external market (to become competitive and measure metrics of success by benchmarking to other companies). 

What is also problematic is that CEO has to live in a relaatively high pressure and some deadline, so multi-player game theory rules should also be
implemented, but at very complex level. The question is how to make decisions rationally and not to yield under pressure. It should also had an module which shoul detect probability of impostor, cheater. Because now CEO is mainly surrounded by coworkers and very often its success is based on theyr trust. 

**Unpopular opinion**

   I know that hype train change its direction and know we are stuffed with buzzwords like 'Ai algo solve mathematical problem',
   but the question is how the test dataset was prepared and where is the border between excellent memorization and average creativity. 
   Because assuming that we have an infinite number of resources we can teach any algorithm literally anything in limited amount of time.
