## Motivation

There is always a problem with naming convention, I thought that I have
relatively a lot of things to write on, but when it comes to writing part it seems that it is much harder. 

I was thinking about writing my own thoughts for a long time, but back then there were much more interesting things to do, which gave me nothing. 

I started to realize that spare time projects will never be as phenomenal as I think it will be, because of chronical lack of free time and incessany energy consumption. 

I will be glad if that post is a sign of my own personal new chapter. 
At that moment willingness of creation something that will be useful is crucial.
